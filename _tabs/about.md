Hi, I'm Grant! Currently I am a research assistant at Stanford Medicine in the Quantitative Sciences Unit where I do collaborate with physicians and epidemiologists on lung and brain cancer predicitive;. Here I learned a lot about technical writing, data management, and advanced statistical techniques (survival analysis, time series (longitudinal data) smoothing, functional data analysis, and large-language model assessment). 

Concurrently, I am a backend engineer at a small tech start-up in Palo Alto working mostly in Python. I have been programming since I was a kid and have been maintaining it through personal projects. My favorite language is Java but most of my work is performed in Python or R.

Previously, I was a student researcher at the University of Tsukuba in Shimoda, Japan doing an independently conducted study in coral ecophysiology (big jump, I know), where I got my first taste of academia and succumbing to the allure under-researched topics.

The blog is designed to be an outlet to bolster my statistical knowledge as I prepare for an advanced statistical degree.
